せっかくClaude CodeのようなAIエージェントを導入したなら、できるだけほったらかしで成果を出したいものだ。
しかしAIに複雑な機能を開発させたら明後日の方向に進むリスクはまだまだ高い。

それを防ぐ方法の一つが仕様駆動開発（Spec Driven Development）とかテスト駆動開発（Test Driven Development）なんだろうなと思う。
私の理解するメリットをあげると、

* 仕様駆動開発は仕様を満たすようにタスクを細分化し、明確と集中可能なコンテキストを提供する
* テスト駆動開発は完了条件をテスト化し、コンテキストが複雑化したとしてもゴールだけは明瞭に保つ

といったところだろうか。

人間からしたら別に新しいことではない。ここまでしても方向性を違えてきたところすら、新規性がない。

* 最初に仕様を決めきろうとするが、決めきれるほど単純な要求ばかりではなく、理解の不足や誤りが仕様を汚染する
* 仮に正しく仕様を決めたとして、作業可能なレベルに細分化したタスクが、Specのどの位置に存在するかを見失う
* 仕様があいまいであれば、なにをテストすべきか見えない

その結果、このタスクってなにを目指してたんだっけ、わからないけど、聞く相手もいないし、進めよう。できた。え、求めてたのと違う？
なんて悲しい結末を繰り返してきた。

この課題に対してスクラムの知見を導入したAI特化型スクラム「Agentic Scrum」を検証しているので紹介したい。
スクラムガイドや実際のスクラム開発の経験をベースに、AI開発での私の経験を加味した手法だ。

## Agentic Scrumで開発の方向性をぶれにくくする

AIを使った開発はコンテキスト（文脈）の扱いとの戦いだ。
仕様駆動開発はコンテキストの複雑化を予防し、テスト駆動開発は複雑化しやすいコンテキストの中で正しい状態を維持する。

しかし、コンテキストの理解不足やコンテキストの肥大化との戦いに不足を感じる。

* コンテキストを正しく構築できれば理想の仕様ができるし、正しくテストすべきことも見える
* コンテキストサイズが適正なら仕様を維持できる

スクラムでこれらの問題に挑んでみよう。
スクラムは有名なフレームワークだからAIも理解しやすい。

### スクラムの課題整理術が仕様駆動開発を補完する

アジャイルとかスクラムが導入された背景の一部は、まさにこの問題に立ち向かうためだ。

特にスクラムはやりたいこととやることの整理がうまく設計されている。

* やりたいことの整理（Product Backlog Refinement）
    * 「○○として、△△ができる。それは××のためだ」というUser Story形式のProduct Backlog Item（PBI）を使い、機能追加がどんな価値をもたらすかを明確にする
    * 仕様を決めきれないようなPBIであれば、分割する。分割するときは優先度に応じて並べかえられるよう独立で、どこからやってもユーザーに価値をもたらすPBIにする
    * PBIの優先順位を価値の大きさや仕様の決めやすさに応じて見直す
* 直近でやることの整理（Sprint Planning）
    * 優先度の高いPBIをやることに決める
    * PBI達成に必要な開発項目を洗い出す
        * 開発項目単体で価値を出す必要はない

小さくとも価値があり着手可能なやりたいことから進めていけば、方向性は見失いにくいし、進め方のわからないやりたいこともプロジェクトの進行と共に理解が深まっていく。
というのも、価値を築いていく過程で、我々は技術的な成長とドメイン知識の獲得が進むからだ。

Spec Driven Developmentでは最初に仕様を決めようとした。
スクラムを導入すれば決められるところから決めていける。

Spec Driven Developmentではタスクを作業の独立性の観点から一度に細分化した。
スクラムを導入すればタスクを価値の独立性の観点から細分化した上で、作業の独立性の観点でも細分化できる。

迷いが減る。

### スクラムの検査術がテスト駆動開発を補完する

テスト駆動開発もすごくスクラムっぽいことを言っている。
テストが書ける、つまりわかるところからやってけと。

スクラムは価値の観点を優先順位に加えているところが秀逸だ。

双方を意識すると、頭を悩ませがちな結合テストやE2Eテストみたいなテストサイズの大きなものについて、何をテストすべきか、1つの指標を与えてくれる。

つまり、単体テストより大きいところで必須なテストは「PBIが目的とする価値を実現できているかテストする」ことだ。

もちろん他にE2Eテストや結合テストを実装してもいいが、それは価値というよりリファクタしやすい保守性の観点だろう。

価値の検証方法がわかれば、迷っても立ち返る場所ができる。

## Agentic Scrumを構築する

スクラム万歳！と言いたいところだが、おそらくスクラムをAIに最適化する必要がある。

たとえばスクラムは一定期間（1スプリント）ごとに進捗を検査するスプリントレビューがある。
ここにはステークホルダーを呼んで、完成したPBIを見せてフィードバックをもらう。
しかし、AIにスプリントごとに止まってもらうのは無駄だ。
人を介さず進められるところまで何スプリントでも進めてもらって、止まったところでレビューしたほうがいい。

そのためには、Product Backlog Itemの優先順位の決めかたもかわるだろう。
人だったら次のリリースで検証したい市場価値は何かを考えて、関連するPBIは優先度を高めにする。
多少、わからないことがあっても、探索的に着手しスプリント期間満了と共に振り返って方向性を調整する。
しかし、AIは時間の制約がないために、不明点に延々と取り組み、方向性のずれを大きくするリスクがある。
AIが単独でやれるPBIをとにかく高優先に設定し、人が必要なPBIは後回しにするのがよいだろう。

Product Backlog Itemの整理（Product Backlog Refinement）は、とにかく次のスプリントプランニングを着手可能にしておくことが目標だ。
いつ行ってもいいが、人を集める性質上、週1回などの定期開催が多い。
定期開催といっても、スプリントの切れ間で開催する方針にすると、タイムボックスの制限でスプリントプランニングを着手可能にできない恐れがある。
だから、スプリントサイクルの途中で定期開催しつつ、必要に応じて追加開催するのがよいだろう。
しかし、AIにとっては途中で余計な作業を挟む必然性はないし、タイムボックスを守る必要もない。
だから、スプリントの切れ目で行うとよいだろう。

人のスプリントはタイムボックスがあるため、その間で完了できる複数のPBIを目標にする。
しかし、AIにタイムボックスは不要だ。
いっそプロダクトバックログリファインメントやスプリントレトロスペクティブの頻度を上げて、適応性を高めたほうがよいかもしれない。
すなわち1スプリント1PBI完了を目標にするのがいいだろう。

こんな感じで、スクラムの各要素をAIに最適化していこうとしている。

## ENJOY!

AIエージェントをできるだけほったらかしにして、適切な方向性を維持しつつ開発を進めたいと思ってAgentic Scrumを構築中だ。

取り組みにはちょっと成果が出ていて、何度やってもうまくいかなかったAI駆動個人開発が急速に前進するようになった。

そのあたりはまた別の記事にするつもりだ。

# The 2020 Scrum Guide<sup>TM</sup>

This HTML version of the Scrum Guide is a direct port of the November 2020 version available [as a PDF here](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100).

## Purpose of the Scrum Guide

We developed Scrum in the early 1990s. We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide in 2010 to help people worldwide understand Scrum. We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional updates. Together, we stand behind it.

The Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.

We follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see Scrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product development where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts, scientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the word “developers” in Scrum not to exclude, but to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.

As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in this document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the Scrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for using within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere.

## Scrum Definition

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

1.  A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.

2.  The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.

3.  The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

4.  *Repeat*

Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.

Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.

## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### Transparency

The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

### Inspection

The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.

Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

### Adaptation

If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

## Scrum Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

***Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage***

The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.

## Scrum Team

The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.

Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.

The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. Scrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team: the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.

### Developers

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.

The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:

-   Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;

-   Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;

-   Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,

-   Holding each other accountable as professionals.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:

-   Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;

-   Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;

-   Ordering Product Backlog items; and,

-   Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.

The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.

Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:

-   Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;

-   Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;

-   Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,

-   Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:

-   Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;

-   Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;

-   Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,

-   Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

-   Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;

-   Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;

-   Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,

-   Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

## Scrum Events

The Sprint is a container for all other events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

### The Sprint

Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.

They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

-   No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;

-   Quality does not decrease;

-   The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,

-   Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

### Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal. The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.

Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:

#### Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?

The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

#### Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?

Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.

Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.

#### Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?

For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.

The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

### Daily Scrum

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work.

### Sprint Review

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.

The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

### Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

-   For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.

-   For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.

-   For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.

These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.

The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

#### Commitment: Product Goal

The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.

> *A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.*

The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.

#### Commitment: Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.

### Increment

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.

#### Commitment: Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.

The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.

If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.

The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.

## End Note

Scrum is free and offered in this Guide. The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

### Acknowledgements

#### People

Of the thousands of people who have contributed to Scrum, we should single out those who were instrumental at the start: Jeff Sutherland worked with Jeff McKenna and John Scumniotales, and Ken Schwaber worked with Mike Smith and Chris Martin, and all of them worked together. Many others contributed in the ensuing years and without their help Scrum would not be refined as it is today.

#### Scrum Guide History

Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland first co-presented Scrum at the OOPSLA Conference in 1995. It essentially documented the learning that Ken and Jeff gained over the previous few years and made public the first formal definition of Scrum.

The Scrum Guide documents Scrum as developed, evolved, and sustained for 30-plus years by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. Other sources provide patterns, processes, and insights that complement the Scrum framework. These may increase productivity, value, creativity, and satisfaction with the results.

The complete history of Scrum is described elsewhere. To honor the first places where it was tried and proven, we recognize Individual Inc., Newspage, Fidelity Investments, and IDX (now GE Medical).

## 具体的なAgentic Scrumフレームワーク

ここまでの議論を踏まえて、AI特化型スクラム「Agentic Scrum」のフレームワークを具体的に設計した。
実際にClaude Codeのカスタムエージェント機能を使って実装し、運用している。

### 基本原則

Agentic Scrumは以下の3つの原則に基づく。

1. **単一の真実源（Single Source of Truth）**: すべてのスクラムアーティファクトはダッシュボードファイル（`plan.md`）に集約する。AIエージェントはこのファイルを読み書きし、情報を共有する
2. **Gitが履歴**: タイムスタンプは不要。Gitのコミット履歴が変更履歴を追跡する
3. **順序が優先度**: リストの上にあるものほど優先度が高い。別途優先度フィールドを設ける必要はない

### 1 Sprint = 1 PBI

人間のスクラムはタイムボックスでイベントのオーバーヘッドを分散させる。
たとえば2週間のスプリントで複数のPBIに取り組む間に、1回のリファインメントを行うといった具合だ。

AIエージェントにはそのような制約がない。
スクラムイベントは一瞬で終わるため、イテレーションを最大化するために1スプリント1PBIを採用する。

- スプリントプランニング = バックログから一番上の`ready`アイテムを選ぶ
- スプリントレビュー/レトロスペクティブ = PBI完了ごとに実施
- 固定期間なし - PBIが完了したらスプリント終了

利点は明確だ。フィードバックが早く、プランニングがシンプルで、インクリメントがきれいに分かれ、ロールバックも容易になる。

### Definition of Ready: AIが単独で完了できるか

AIエージェント向けのDefinition of Readyは「**AIが人に聞かずに完了できるか**」に尽きる。

| ステータス | 意味 |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | 初期アイデア。詳細化が必要 |
| `refining` | リファインメント中。AIが`ready`にできるかもしれない |
| `ready` | 必要な情報が揃っている。AIが自律的に実行可能 |

リファインメントのプロセスは以下の通りだ。

1. AIが`draft`/`refining`アイテムを自律的にリファインメントしようとする（コードベース探索、受け入れ基準の提案、依存関係の特定）
2. AIがすべてのギャップを埋められれば → ステータスを`ready`に変更
3. ストーリーが大きすぎたり不明確であれば → INVEST原則を満たしながら最小単位に分割する。分割によりスプリントサイクルが短くなり、フィードバックの頻度が増える。AIエージェントにとってスクラムイベントは一瞬で終わるため、細かく分割するほど検査と適応の機会が増え、方向性のずれを早期に発見できる
4. 分割できないアイテムがまだ人の助けを必要とするなら → `refining`のまま質問を文書化

優先順位付けは`ready`アイテムを優先する。
`ready`アイテムがない場合や人の入力を待っている間はリファインメント作業を行う。

### Definition of Done: AIエージェント向けの完了基準

スクラムガイドにおいて、Definition of Done（DoD）は「インクリメントが製品に必要な品質基準を満たした状態」を定義する。
Agentic Scrumでは、AIエージェントが自律的に検証できる形式でDoDを定義する。

**基本チェック項目:**

| 項目 | 検証方法 |
|------|----------|
| すべてのテストが合格 | `cargo test` / `npm test` など実行可能なコマンド |
| リントが合格 | `cargo clippy` / `npm run lint` など |
| 型チェックが合格 | `tsc --noEmit` / `mypy src/` など |
| 受け入れ基準の検証コマンドがすべて成功 | PBIに記載された各検証コマンドを実行 |

**AIエージェント特有の項目:**

- **コミット履歴が適切**: TDDサイクルに従い、Red/Green/Refactorの各フェーズでコミットされている
- **構造的変更と振る舞い変更が分離されている**: Tidy First原則に従い、リファクタリングと機能追加が別コミットになっている
- **ダッシュボードが更新済み**: サブタスクのステータスがすべて`completed`になっている

DoDは固定ではなく、レトロスペクティブでの学びに基づいて進化させる。
品質問題が繰り返し発生する場合は、DoDに新しいチェック項目を追加して再発を防ぐ。

### ロール: AIエージェントによるスクラムチーム

Claude Codeのカスタムエージェント機能を使って、スクラムの各ロールをAIエージェントとして実装した。

| エージェント | 読み取り | 書き込み |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Product Owner | ダッシュボード全体 | Product Backlog、Product Goal、Sprint受け入れ |
| Scrum Master | ダッシュボード全体 | Sprint設定、レトロスペクティブ、メトリクス |
| Developer | Sprint Backlog、DoD | サブタスクステータス、進捗、メモ |
| イベントエージェント | 関連セクション | イベント固有の出力 |

#### Product Owner (`@scrum-team-product-owner`)

Product Ownerは価値の最大化に責任を持つ。
AIエージェント版では以下の特徴がある。

- Product Goalの策定と伝達
- User Story形式でのPBI作成（実行可能な受け入れ基準付き）
- バックログの順序付け（リスト内の位置が優先度）
- PBIがAI実行可能な状態かの確認

重要なのは、受け入れ基準には必ず**実行可能な検証コマンド**を含めることだ。
たとえば `pytest tests/auth/test_login.py -v` のように、AIが自動でテストを実行して結果を確認できるようにする。

#### Scrum Master (`@scrum-team-scrum-master`)

Scrum Masterはフレームワークの維持と障害除去に責任を持つ。
AIエージェント向けには以下の点で最適化している。

- スクラムガイドに厳格に従う（https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html を参照）
- 経験主義の3本柱（透明性、検査、適応）を体現
- 障害発生時のPBI優先順位調整の支援
- エージェント間の調整

人間のチームではサーバントリーダーとして振る舞うが、AIエージェントに対してはより指示的に振る舞う。
これは明確な理解と実行を保証するためだ。

#### Developer (`@scrum-team-developer`)

Developerは実装に責任を持つ。
テスト駆動開発（TDD）との統合が特徴だ。

- TDDワークフロー: Red → Green → Refactor
- サブタスクは各TDDフェーズでコミットを生成
- Tidy Firstの原則に従い、構造的変更と振る舞い変更を分離
- 障害発生時はサブタスクとして追加、または新PBIを提案

サブタスクのステータス遷移は以下の通りだ。

```
pending -> red -> green -> refactoring -> completed
            |      |          |
         (commit)(commit)  (commit x N)
```

### イベント: スプリントサイクル

従来のスクラムではProduct Backlog Refinementはスプリントイベントから独立しており、スプリント中のいつでも行える。
しかしAgentic Scrumでは、以下の理由からスプリントサイクルの一部として位置づけている。

1. **AIには「余暇時間」がない**: 人間はスプリント中の空き時間にリファインメントするが、AIは常に次のタスクを処理している
2. **スプリント間が一瞬**: 1 Sprint = 1 PBIなので、スプリント終了から次の開始まで待つ余裕がある
3. **次のPBIの準備が明確なゴール**: リファインメントの目的は「次のPBIを`ready`にする」ことであり、スプリント開始前に行うのが自然

したがって、Agentic Scrumのスプリントサイクルは以下のようになる。

```
Retro -> Refinement -> Planning -> Execution -> Review -> (next Retro)
```

レトロスペクティブの後にリファインメントを行うことで、レトロスペクティブで得た学びをリファインメントに反映できる。
また、リファインメントでPBIが`ready`になってからプランニングに入るため、プランニングがスムーズになる。

各イベントも専用エージェントとして実装している。

#### Sprint (`@scrum-event-sprint`)

スプリントはスクラムガイドにおいて「他のすべてのイベントのコンテナ」と定義されている。
スプリント中は以下のことが守られる。

- スプリントゴールを危険にさらすような変更は行わない
- 品質を下げない
- 必要に応じてプロダクトバックログをリファインメントする
- 学びが増えたらプロダクトオーナーとスコープを明確化・再交渉する

Agentic Scrumでは1スプリント1PBIを採用しているため、スプリントの期間はPBIの完了までとなる。
固定期間がないため、タイムボックスによるリズムは失われるが、代わりにPBI完了ごとに検査と適応の機会が得られる。
AIエージェントにとってはこの方が自然だ。人間のように「2週間後に集まる」必要がなく、完了した瞬間にレビューとレトロスペクティブを実施できる。

スプリントのキャンセルはプロダクトオーナーのみが行える。
スプリントゴールが陳腐化した場合（市場の変化、戦略的な方向転換など）に検討されるが、AIエージェント環境では1PBIが小さく分割されているため、キャンセルよりも完了させて次に進む方が効率的な場合が多い。

#### Sprint Planning (`@scrum-event-sprint-planning`)

スプリントプランニングは3つのトピックを扱う。

1. **Why**: Sprint Goalを策定する
2. **What**: どのPBIに取り組むか選択する
3. **How**: 開発者が初期計画を立てる

1 Sprint = 1 PBIなので、プランニングは極めてシンプルになる。
バックログの一番上の`ready`アイテムを選び、サブタスクに分解するだけだ。

#### Daily Scrum (`@scrum-event-daily-scrum`)

人間のスクラムにおけるデイリースクラムは、チームメンバー間の情報共有とスプリントゴールに向けた進捗の検査が目的だ。
しかし、AIエージェントが単独で作業する場合、他のメンバーとの情報共有は必要ない。

では、デイリースクラムは不要か？
むしろ**目的を再解釈**することで、より高頻度な検査の場として活用できる。

AIエージェント版デイリースクラムは、以下のタイミングで実施する。

- **サブタスク完了ごと**: 次のサブタスクに進む前に、スプリントゴールに向けた進捗を確認する
- **障害発生時**: 問題を記録し、解決策を検討する
- **方向性に迷ったとき**: スプリントゴールに立ち返り、今やっていることが正しいか確認する

検査項目は以下の通りだ。

1. スプリントゴールに向けてどこまで進んだか
2. 次に何をすべきか
3. 障害はあるか

「毎日」ではなく「毎サブタスク」という頻度にすることで、AIエージェントの作業ペースに合った検査サイクルを実現できる。
タイムボックスは不要だが、検査のタイミングを明確にすることで、方向性のずれを早期に発見できる。

#### Sprint Review (`@scrum-event-sprint-review`)

スプリントレビューはデモではなく**作業セッション**だ。
AIエージェント版では以下を重視する。

- 完了したインクリメントの検査（Definition of Doneを満たしているか）
- 受け入れ基準の検証コマンドをすべて実行
- Product Ownerによる受け入れ判定

インクリメントがない場合でもレビューは**絶対にスキップしない**。
状況を議論し、なぜ完了しなかったかを透明に共有する。

#### Sprint Retrospective (`@scrum-event-sprint-retrospective`)

レトロスペクティブは品質と効果を高める方法を計画する場だ。

**重要なのは、今回のスプリントだけに注目しないことだ。**
前回のレトロスペクティブで決めた改善アクションが効果を発揮したかを検査し、その結果に基づいて次の適応を考える必要がある。
改善アクションは「やって終わり」ではなく、継続的に効果を測定し、必要に応じて調整する。

5フェーズ構造を採用している。

1. **Set the Stage**: 安全な場を作る
2. **Gather Data**: 何が起きたか共有する
3. **Generate Insights**: なぜそうなったか分析する
4. **Decide What to Do**: 改善アクションを選ぶ
5. **Close**: まとめと感謝

改善アクションはSprintバックログ（チーム内プロセス改善）またはProduct Backlog（製品に影響する技術的負債など）に追加する。

AIエージェント特有の改善として、**エージェント定義の更新**がある。
レトロスペクティブで見つかった問題がエージェントの振る舞いに起因する場合、エージェント定義（システムプロンプト）を改善することで、同じ問題の再発を防げる。
たとえば「テストを書く前に実装を始めてしまった」という問題があれば、Developer エージェントの定義にTDDの手順をより明確に記述する。
これはAIエージェントの自己組織化を高める成長プロセスだ。
人間のチームが学習して成長するように、AIエージェントも定義の更新を通じて成長していく。

#### Backlog Refinement (`@scrum-event-backlog-refinement`)

バックログリファインメントはPBIを`ready`状態にするためのイベントだ。

INVEST原則に従ってPBIを評価する。
ただし、AIエージェント環境ではいくつかの原則を再解釈する必要がある。

- **Independent（独立）**: 他のストーリーから独立して開発・デリバリー可能。AIエージェントにとっては**人間への依存がないこと**も重要だ。外部APIの認証情報が必要、デザインの承認待ちなど、人間の介入が必要なPBIは`ready`とみなさない
- **Negotiable（交渉可能）**: 詳細は交渉可能、解決策でなく成果に焦点。AIエージェントは曖昧さを苦手とするため、**成果を明確にしつつも実装手段は柔軟に**保つバランスが重要だ。「ログイン機能を実装する」より「ユーザーがメールアドレスとパスワードで認証できる」の方がAIには扱いやすい
- **Valuable（価値）**: 明確なビジネス価値がある。AIエージェントが価値を判断することは難しいため、**なぜこのPBIが重要かをUser Storyの形式で明示**しておく
- **Estimable（見積可能）**: 見積もり可能（大きな不明点がない）。AIエージェントにとって見積もりは時間ではなく**完了に必要な情報がすべて揃っているか**を意味する。「調査が必要」「仕様未定」などの項目があれば`ready`ではない
- **Small（小さい）**: AIエージェントにとって「Small」は時間の観点ではなく、**これ以上分割するとユーザー価値を失う最小単位**を意味する。1スプリント1PBIの原則により、できるだけ小さく分割することでフィードバックサイクルを増やせる
- **Testable（テスト可能）**: 具体的で測定可能な受け入れ基準がある。AIエージェント向けの最重要原則だ。**実行可能な検証コマンド**（`pytest tests/auth/test_login.py -v`など）を持たない受け入れ基準は、AIにとっては検証不能に等しい

### アーティファクト: ダッシュボードの構造

すべてのアーティファクトは`plan.md`ファイルに集約される。
YAML形式でデータを記述し、AIエージェントが容易に読み書きできるようにしている。

基本原則で述べた3つのルールがここに反映されている。

- **単一の真実源**: すべての情報がこの1ファイルに集約
- **Gitが履歴**: タイムスタンプフィールドがない
- **順序が優先度**: `product_backlog`配列の上にあるものほど優先度が高い

```yaml
# Product Goal
product_goal:
  statement: "ユーザーがゼロ設定でシンタックスハイライトを利用できる"
  success_metrics:
    - metric: "ゼロ設定スモークテスト"
      target: "設定なしでファイルを開くとハイライトが動作する"

# Product Backlog（順序が優先度を表す）
product_backlog:
  - id: PBI-001
    story:
      role: "開発者"
      capability: "設定なしでシンタックスハイライトを利用できる"
      benefit: "セットアップ時間をゼロにできる"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: "設定なしでサーバー起動時にデフォルトパスを使用する"
        verification: "cargo test test_default_paths -- --nocapture"
    status: ready  # draft | refining | ready
    # dependencies: [] # 必要に応じて追加

# Current Sprint（1 Sprint = 1 PBI）
sprint:
  number: 1
  pbi_id: PBI-001
  status: in_progress  # planning | in_progress | review | done
  subtasks:
    - test: "デフォルトパスが設定される"
      implementation: "WorkspaceSettings::default()を修正"
      type: behavioral  # behavioral | structural
      status: green  # pending | red | green | refactoring | completed
      commits:
        - phase: red
          message: "test: デフォルトパスが設定される"
        - phase: green
          message: "feat: デフォルトパスをWorkspaceSettingsに追加"

# Definition of Done（実行可能な検証コマンドのリスト）
definition_of_done:
  checks:
    - name: "テスト合格"
      run: "cargo test"
    - name: "リント合格"
      run: "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
    - name: "型チェック合格"
      run: "cargo check"

# Completed Sprints
completed: []

# Retrospectives（改善アクションの追跡を含む）
retrospectives:
  - sprint: 1
    improvements:
      - action: "TDDサイクルをより厳格に適用する"
        backlog: sprint  # sprint | product
        status: active  # active | completed | abandoned
        outcome: null  # 次回レトロで効果を検査する
    happiness: 4  # 1-5のチームハピネス指標
```

#### ダッシュボードのコンパクト化

AIエージェントはコンテキストの肥大化を嫌う。
プロジェクトが進むにつれてダッシュボードが膨れ上がると、AIの判断精度が落ち、トークンコストも増大する。
そのため、ダッシュボードを常にコンパクトに保つ戦略が重要だ。

**コンパクト化の原則:**

1. **完了スプリントの最小化**: `completed`配列には最新の2-3スプリント分だけを保持する。それより古いものは削除する
2. **レトロスペクティブの要約化**: 古いレトロスペクティブは`improvements`の`completed`/`abandoned`アイテムを削除し、学びのエッセンスだけをコメントとして残す
3. **Product Backlogの剪定**: `done`になったPBIはバックログから削除する。完了したPBIの履歴が必要ならgitログから参照する

人間であれば「gitログを見るのは面倒だから、ある程度の経緯をダッシュボードに残したい」と思うかもしれない。
しかしAIエージェントにとってgitログの検索は苦にならない。
`git log --oneline --grep="PBI-001"`のようなコマンドで関連コミットを瞬時に抽出できるし、必要なら`git show`で詳細も確認できる。
むしろダッシュボードに過去の情報を残しておくと、毎回のコンテキストが肥大化してAIの判断精度に悪影響を与える。
**AIにとって最適なのは、現在のダッシュボードをミニマルに保ち、必要なときだけgitから履歴を引き出すアプローチだ。**

**Gitが履歴を担保する:**

ダッシュボードからデータを削除しても、過去の状態はすべてgitの履歴に残っている。
必要なときは`git log -p -- plan.md`や`git show <commit>:plan.md`で任意の時点のダッシュボードを復元できる。
だからこそ、現在のダッシュボードは**今必要な情報だけ**に絞り込める。

**コンパクト化のタイミング:**

- スプリントレトロスペクティブの終了時（次のスプリント開始前）
- ダッシュボードが一定行数（例: 200行）を超えたとき
- AIエージェントが「コンテキストが長すぎる」旨の警告を出したとき

この「削除しても復元可能」という安心感があるからこそ、積極的にダッシュボードを剪定できる。
スクラムの透明性は現在の状態の透明性であり、過去のすべてを常に見えるようにしておく必要はない。

ダッシュボードの構造は、フレームワーク内で論じた概念を反映している。

- **PBIのstatus**: Definition of Readyの`draft`/`refining`/`ready`を表現
- **subtasksのtype**: Tidy First原則の`behavioral`/`structural`を区別
- **subtasksのstatus**: TDDサイクルの各フェーズを追跡
- **retrospectives.improvements**: 前回の改善アクションとその効果を追跡し、継続的な検査と適応を可能にする

### TDDとの統合

Agentic ScrumはTDD（テスト駆動開発）と密接に統合している。

各サブタスクはRed-Green-Refactorサイクルに従う。

1. **Red**: 失敗するテストを書いてコミット
2. **Green**: テストを通す最小限のコードを書いてコミット
3. **Refactor**: 構造を改善し、各改善ごとにコミット

Tidy Firstの原則により、振る舞いの変更と構造の変更は別のコミットにする。
これによりAIが迷走しても、いつでも安全なグリーン状態に戻れる。

### 障害管理

障害（Impediment）はスクラムの公式アーティファクトではない。スクラムガイドでは「スクラムマスターはスクラムチームの進捗を妨げる障害を取り除く責任がある」と述べているのみで、障害の管理方法については言及していない。

**Agentic Scrumでは障害を独立して管理せず、PBIとして扱うことを推奨する。**

理由は以下の通りだ。

1. **単一の情報源**: Product Backlogだけを見れば状況を把握できる。別途障害リストを管理すると、AIエージェントが参照すべき場所が増え、コンテキストが肥大化する
2. **優先順位で緊急度を表現**: 障害を解決するPBIをProduct Backlogの最上位に置けば、最優先で対応される。緊急度のための別フィールドは不要だ
3. **ライフサイクルの統一**: 障害解決の`investigating` -> `resolved`は、PBIの`draft` -> `ready` -> `done`と概念的に対応する。別のフローを設ける必要はない
4. **解決試行の記録**: 障害解決PBIのサブタスクとして試行を記録すればよい。通常の開発と同じ構造で管理できる
5. **エスカレーション**: 人間の助けが必要なら、PBIを`refining`のまま停止し、質問を文書化すればよい。これはリファインメントで`ready`にできないPBIと同じ扱いだ

障害が発生したら、以下のように対応する。

**スプリント中に発生した場合:**

```yaml
# 現在のスプリントのサブタスクとして追加
sprint:
  subtasks:
    - test: "外部APIタイムアウトの調査と解決"
      implementation: "タイムアウト設定の見直し、リトライ機構の追加"
      type: behavioral
      status: pending
      notes:
        - "30秒に延長 -> まだ失敗"
        - "リトライ3回追加 -> 成功"
```

**スプリントゴールを達成できない場合:**

障害がスプリントゴールの達成を完全にブロックする場合は、現在のスプリントを中断し、障害解決を新しいPBIとしてProduct Backlogの最上位に追加する。

```yaml
product_backlog:
  - id: PBI-HOTFIX-001
    story:
      role: "開発者"
      capability: "外部APIとの通信を安定させる"
      benefit: "認証機能の開発を再開できる"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: "APIタイムアウトが発生しない"
        verification: "cargo test test_api_connection -- --nocapture"
    status: ready  # 調査が十分なら ready、不明点があれば refining
```

人間の介入が必要な場合は、PBIを`refining`のまま停止し、必要な質問を文書化する。
これは通常のリファインメントと同じフローだ。

なお、障害の根本原因がシステム的な問題である場合は、解決後に技術的負債としてPBIを登録し、再発防止に取り組む。

### 実際の運用例

実際にこのフレームワークを使って開発しているプロジェクト（treesitter-ls）では、以下のような成果が出ている。

- スプリント9まで進行し、複数のPBIを完了
- 各PBIは明確な受け入れ基準と検証コマンドを持つ
- AIが自律的にリファインメント、実装、レビューを実施
- 障害が発生してもPBIとして管理し、優先順位に従って解決

重要なのは、人間が介入するタイミングが明確になったことだ。
AIが`ready`にできないPBIがあれば、それは人間の判断が必要なサインだ。
障害解決PBIが`refining`のまま停止していれば、それは人間が解決すべき問題だ。

ほったらかしにしつつも、必要なときだけ人間が介入する。
それがAgentic Scrumの目指す姿だ。

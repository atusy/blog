This article introduces a new feature from **rmarkdown** 2.24, [`output_format_dependency()`].

R Markdown users use variety of output formats from variety of packages such as `html_document`, `bookdown::git_book`, `revealjs::revealjs_presentation`, and so on

Usually, users specify the YAML frontmatter to choose and tweak formats.

``` yaml
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
```

Some people may be surprised, but the output formats are R functions!
And the above example is tweaking the output format by specifying function arguments via the YAML frontmatter.
Output formats already provide customizibility.

But what if we want further customizations?

Then, [`output_format_dependency()`] is for you.
This new feature allows you to modify output format **from within chunk**.

The example below adds a lua filter and a post processor.
You can try it simply by copy and paste it to a chunk of your Rmd files.

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::output_format_dependency(
  name = "example",
  pre_processor = function(...) {
    # add lua filter to automatically add line numbers to CodeBlock
    filterfile <- tempfile()
    filterurl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atusy/lua-filters/master/lua/auto-number-lines.lua"
    download.file(filterurl, filterfile)
    rmarkdown::pandoc_lua_filter_args(filterfile)
  },
  post_processor = function(metadata, input_file, output_file, ...) {
    # make a copy suffixed by timestamp
    output_file2 <- sub(
      "([.][^.]+)$",
      paste0("-", Sys.time(), "\\1"),
      output_file
    )
    file.copy(output_file, output_file2, overwrite = TRUE)
    output_file
  }
)
```

If you have an experience with defining custom output formats, you probably notice that [`output_format_dependency()`] and [`output_format()`] shares most of the arguments.
[`output_format_dependency()`] can do almost evertyhing the [`output_format()`] does.
Exception is the `knitr` argument in [`output_format()`] because [`output_format_dependency()`] is declared during knit and merged to original output format after knit.

Compared to [`output_format()`], [`output_format_dependency()`] has advantages for both users and R package developers because [`output_format_dependency()`] works **from within chunk**.

For users, the advantage is that they do not have to dive into developer's world.
There are several ways to use [`output_format()`], but all are slightly complex: writing `.Rprofile`, writing an R script, or writing an R package, and so on.
If users want to re-use the [`output_format_dependency()`] in multiple Rmd files, then factor out the Rmd file and include it by other documents by [child](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#child-documents) chunk option.

For R package developers, the advantage is that they do not have to define multiple output formats just for sharing the same dependency.
The previous example has a post processor that makes a copy of the output file suffixed by timestamp.
This can be considered as a format-agnostic feature, however, the usage of [`output_format()`] means defining `timestamped_html_document()`, `timestamped_pdf_document()`, `timestamped_word_document()`, and so on.
This is a nightmare.
Instead, by using [`output_format_dependency()`], developers just have to export a function, and let users use a function in Rmd files.

In the future, I will implement `attach_output_format_dependencies()` which works like `htmltools::attachDependencies()`.
Then R packages can provide widgets that can automatically import variety of dependencies such as Lua filters.

## Call for sponsorships

I deeply appreciate my sponsors that supports my contributions (https://github.com/sponsors/atusy).

If you liked my contributions and started sponsorship, I would be more than happy!
My contributions are slow these days because I am not using R these days.
In such a situation, the sponsorship really motivates me to contribute to R community.
